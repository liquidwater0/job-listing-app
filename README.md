## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I learned

Learned a little about how file paths work with vite.

```js
function getLogoPath() {
    if (import.meta.env.PROD) return `${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}assets/${logo}`;
    if (import.meta.env.DEV) return `../../../src/assets/${logo}`;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I want to try and improve on my CSS and JavaScript skills, as well as improving how I do my file structure.
